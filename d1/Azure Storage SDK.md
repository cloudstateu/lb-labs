# Lab: Retrieving Azure Storage resources and metadata by using the Azure Storage SDK for .NET

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

-   Create containers and upload blobs by using the Azure portal.

-   Enumerate blobs and containers by using the Microsoft Azure Storage SDK for .NET.

-   Pull blob metadata by using the Storage SDK.

## Instructions

### Task 1: Create a Storage account

1.  Create a new storage account with the following details:
    
    -    Resource group: **YOUR_REDSOURCE_GROUP**

    -    Name: **CHOOSE_NAME**

    -    Location: **West Europe**

    -    Performance: **Standard**

    -    Account kind: **StorageV2 (general purpose v2)**

    -    Replication: **LRS**

    -    Access tier: **Hot**

    > **Note**: Wait for Azure to finish creating the storage account before you move forward with the lab. You'll receive a notification when the account is created.

2.  Open the **Properties** section of your newly created storage account instance.

3.  Record the value in the **Primary Blob Service Endpoint** text box. You'll use this value later in this lab.

4.  Open the **Access Keys** section of the storage account instance.

5.  Record the value in the **Storage account name** text box and any of the **Key** text boxes. You'll use these values later in this lab.

### Task 2: Create storage account containers

1.  Access the storage account that you created earlier in this lab.

2.  Select the **Containers** link in the **Blob service** section, and then create a new container with the following settings:
    
    -    Name: **raster-graphics**

    -    Public access level: **Private (no anonymous access)**

3.  Select the **Containers** link in the **Blob service** section, and then create a new container with the following settings:
    
    -    Name: **compressed-audio**

    -    Public access level: **Private (no anonymous access)**

4.  Observe the updated list of containers.

### Task 3: Upload a storage account blob

1.  Access the storage account that you created earlier in this lab.

2.  Select the **Containers** link in the **Blob service** section, and then select the recently created **raster-graphics** container.
    
3.  In the **raster-graphics** container, select **Upload** to upload the **graph.jpg** file.

### Task 4: Create .NET project

1.  Create new folder for a .NET project, enter this folder.

1.  Using a terminal, create a new .NET project named **BlobManager** in the current folder:

    ```
    dotnet new console --name BlobManager --output .
    ```

    > **Note**: The **dotnet new** command will create a new **console** project in a folder with the same name as the project.

1.  Using the same terminal, import version 12.0.0 of **Azure.Storage.Blobs** from NuGet:

    ```
    dotnet add package Azure.Storage.Blobs --version 12.0.0
    ```

    > **Note**: The **dotnet add package** command will add the **Azure.Storage.Blobs** package from NuGet. For more information, go to [Azure.Storage.Blobs](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.Storage.Blobs/12.0.0).

1.  Using the same terminal, build the .NET web application:

    ```
    dotnet build
    ```

1.  Close the current terminal.

### Task 5: Modify the Program class to access Storage

1.  Open the **Program.cs** file in Visual Studio Code.

1.  Delete all existing code in the **Program.cs** file.

1.  Add the following **using** directives for libraries that will be referenced by the application:

    ```
    using Azure.Storage;
    using Azure.Storage.Blobs;
    using Azure.Storage.Blobs.Models;
    using System;
    using System.Threading.Tasks;
    ```

1.  Create a new **Program** class with three constant string properties named **blobServiceEndpoint**, **storageAccountName**, and **storageAccountKey**, and then create an asynchronous **Main** entry point method:

    ```
    public class Program
    {
        private const string blobServiceEndpoint = "";
        private const string storageAccountName = "";
        private const string storageAccountKey = "";
        
        public static async Task Main(string[] args)
        {
        }
    }
    ```

1.  Update the **blobServiceEndpoint** string constant by setting its value to the **Primary Blob Service Endpoint** of the storage account that you recorded earlier in this lab.

1.  Update the **storageAccountName** string constant by setting its value to the **Storage account name** of the Storage account that you recorded earlier in this lab.

1.  Update the **storageAccountKey** string constant by setting its value to the **Key** of the Storage account that you recorded earlier in this lab.

### Task 6: Connect to the Azure Storage blob service endpoint

1.  In the **Main** method, add the following block of code to connect to the storage account and to retrieve account metadata:

    ```
    StorageSharedKeyCredential accountCredentials = new StorageSharedKeyCredential(storageAccountName, storageAccountKey);

    BlobServiceClient serviceClient = new BlobServiceClient(new Uri(blobServiceEndpoint), accountCredentials);

    AccountInfo info = await serviceClient.GetAccountInfoAsync();
    ```

1.  Still in the **Main** method, add the following block of code to print metadata about the storage account:

    ```
    await Console.Out.WriteLineAsync($"Connected to Azure Storage Account");
    await Console.Out.WriteLineAsync($"Account name:\t{storageAccountName}");
    await Console.Out.WriteLineAsync($"Account kind:\t{info?.AccountKind}");
    await Console.Out.WriteLineAsync($"Account sku:\t{info?.SkuName}");
    ```

1.  Save the **Program.cs** file.

1.  Using a terminal, run the console application project:

    ```
    dotnet run
    ```

2.  Observe the output from the currently running console application. The output contains metadata for the Storage account that was retrieved from the service.

3.  Close the current terminal.

### Task 7: Enumerate the existing containers

1.  In the **Program** class, create a new **private static** method named **EnumerateContainersAsync** that's asynchronous and has a single parameter of type **BlobServiceClient**:

    ```
    private static async Task EnumerateContainersAsync(BlobServiceClient client)
    {        
    }
    ```

1.  In the **EnumerateContainersAsync** method, create an asynchronous **foreach** loop that iterates over the results of an invocation of the **GetBlobContainersAsync** method of the **BlobServiceClient** class and prints out the name of each container:

    ```
    await foreach (BlobContainerItem container in client.GetBlobContainersAsync())
    {
        await Console.Out.WriteLineAsync($"Container:\t{container.Name}");
    }
    ```

1.  In the **Main** method, add a new line of code to invoke the **EnumerateContainersAsync** method, passing in the *serviceClient* variable as a parameter:

    ```
    await EnumerateContainersAsync(serviceClient);
    ```

1.  Save the **Program.cs** file.

1.  Using a terminal, run the console application project:

    ```
    dotnet run
    ```

    ```
    await foreach (BlobItem blob in container.GetBlobsAsync())
    {
        await Console.Out.WriteLineAsync($"Existing Blob:\t{blob.Name}");
    }
    ```

1.  In the **Main** method, add a new line of code to create a variable named *existingContainerName* with a value of **raster-graphics**:

    ```
    await Console.Out.WriteLineAsync($"New Container:\t{container.Name}");
    ```

1.  Return the instance of the **BlobContainerClient** class named **container** as the result of the **GetContainerAsync** method:

    ```
    return container;
    ``` 
    
1.  In the **Main** method, add a new line of code to create a variable named *newContainerName* with a value of **vector-graphics**:

    ```
    string newContainerName = "vector-graphics";

### Task 10: Access blob URI by using the SDK

1. Go to azure portal and upload any image into newly created container ("vector-graphics")

1.  In the **Program** class, create a new **private static** method named **GetBlobAsync** that's asynchronous and has two types of parameters, **BlobContainerClient** and **string**:

    ```
    private static async Task<BlobClient> GetBlobAsync(BlobContainerClient client, string blobName)
    {      
    }
    ```

1.  In the **GetBlobAsync** method, get a new instance of the **BlobClient** class by using the **GetBlobClient** method of the **BlobContainerClient** class, passing in the **blobName** parameter:

    ```
    BlobClient blob = client.GetBlobClient(blobName);
    ```

1.  In the **GetBlobAsync** method, render the name of the blob that was referenced:

    ```
    await Console.Out.WriteLineAsync($"Blob Found:\t{blob.Name}");
    ```

1.  Return the instance of the **BlobClient** class named **blob** as the result of the **GetBlobAsync** method:

    ```
    return blob;
    ```  
    
1.  In the **Main** method, add a new line of code to create a variable named *uploadedBlobName* with a value of **vector-graphics**:

    ```
    string uploadedBlobName = "NAME_OF_YOUR_IMAGE";
    ```

1.  In the **Main** method, add a new line of code to invoke the **GetBlobAsync** method, passing in the *containerClient* and *uploadedBlobName* variables as parameters and store the result in a variable named *blobClient* of type **BlobClient**:

    ```
    BlobClient blobClient = await GetBlobAsync(containerClient, uploadedBlobName);
    ```

1.  In the **Main** method, add a new line of code to render the **Uri** property of the *blobClient* variable:

    ```
    await Console.Out.WriteLineAsync($"Blob Url:\t{blobClient.Uri}");
    ```

1.  Save the **Program.cs** file.

1.  Using a terminal, run the console application project:

    ```
    dotnet run
    ```

2.  Observe the output from the currently running console application. The updated output includes the final URL to access the blob online. Record the value of this URL to use later in the lab.

    > **Note**: The URL will likely be similar to the following string: **https://YOUR_ACCOUNT.blob.core.windows.net/vector-graphics/IMAGE.jpg**

    
3.  Using a new browser window or tab, go to the URL for the blob, and then find the blob's contents. 

4.  You should now notice image that you've uploaded.
